# webmedtools-app (Work In Progress)

This is a web app designed to host multiple tools to help automate the creation of asynchronous tasks assigned to patients by healthcare professionals.

## Current Tools
### Eye Test Generator (Work In Progress)
Generates worksheets following the format of the Michigan Saccades Tracking test often given to patients with concussions, where random combinations of letters of various lengths in paragraph form must be sorted through by the patients. The patient must find the first instance of the letter "a", then the letter "b", all the way up to the letter "z". Patients should also time themselves throughout the process as they complete more "paragraphs" of these randomized letters. Instead of putting the burden of creating these worksheets on healthcare professionals, both patients and healthcare workers can use this tool to generate worksheets and patients can complete as many worksheets as needed to aid their recovery.
